## Roles and Responsibilities

### Solo Developer Approach (Full Stack Data Scientist)

As a Full Stack Data Scientist working solo on this project, you'll wear multiple hats:

**Core Responsibilities**:

- Backend development (FastAPI, data processing pipelines)
- ML modeling and algorithm implementation
- Frontend development (Streamlit → React transition)
- Infrastructure setup and maintenance
- Testing and quality assurance

**Recommended Focus Order**:

1. Data pipeline and processing (highest business value)
2. Core forecasting capabilities
3. User interface improvements
4. Infrastructure and deployment

**Skills Leverage**:

- Use UI frameworks like Streamlit to accelerate frontend development
- Leverage managed services where possible to reduce DevOps burden
- Prioritize well-documented, battle-tested libraries over custom implementations
- Implement automation for testing and deployment early

**Outsourcing Considerations** (if/when needed):

- Complex frontend UI components
- Advanced infrastructure setup (Kubernetes)
- Security auditing
- Performance optimization

This focused approach allows for incremental delivery while managing the workload of a solo developer effectively.

## Transfer Learning for Time Series

### Adaptive Approach for Unknown Data Types

Unlike computer vision or NLP where pre-trained models on standard datasets are widely applicable, time series transfer learning requires a more nuanced approach when building a general-purpose platform:

1. **Domain-Agnostic Model Features**:

   - Focus on extracting universal time series patterns (seasonality, trend components)
   - Leverage models like N-BEATS that learn basis functions applicable across domains
   - Use decomposition approaches that separate universal components from domain-specific ones

2. **One-Shot Learning Strategy**:

   - Implement "model zoos" with quick-fitting base models (ARIMA, Prophet, simple NN models)
   - Create rapid evaluation framework to quickly identify which model class works best
   - Implement automatic model selection based on limited data characteristics
   - Use fast approximate hyperparameter optimization for quick adaptation

3. **When Pre-Trained Models Actually Help**:

   - For similar domains (e.g., retail sales data, energy consumption)
   - When dealing with low-frequency data with limited history
   - For capturing common patterns like day-of-week, holidays, or annual seasonality
   - As initialization points for faster convergence rather than complete solutions

4. **Practical Implementation**:

   ```python
   # Example: Adaptive model selection based on data characteristics
   from darts.models import NBEATSModel, ExponentialSmoothing, AutoARIMA

   def select_and_train_model(time_series, characteristics):
       """Select appropriate model based on series characteristics"""
       if characteristics['seasonality_strength'] > 0.5:
           # Strong seasonality - try N-BEATS with seasonal configuration
           model = NBEATSModel(
               input_chunk_length=24,
               output_chunk_length=12,
               generic_architecture=False  # Use interpretable mode with trend/seasonality
           )
       elif characteristics['series_length'] < 100:
           # Short series - use simpler model
           model = ExponentialSmoothing()
       else:
           # Default to ARIMA for general cases
           model = AutoARIMA()

       # Train with appropriate settings
       model.fit(time_series)
       return model
   ```

5. **Alternative to Traditional Transfer Learning**:
   - Focus on meta-learning approaches (learning to learn quickly from limited data)
   - Implement adaptive preprocessing based on data characteristics
   - Develop a library of common transformations applicable to specific data types
   - Use automated feature engineering instead of transferred representations

This flexible approach creates more value for a general-purpose platform where uploaded data types are unknown, compared to traditional transfer learning which works best with known domains.
