## Questions to Consider

- Which cloud provider is preferred?
- What are the expected data volumes? (Important for Polars/PySpark scaling)
- Are there specific model types that are priorities?
- What level of user technical expertise should we assume?
- Should we prioritize Neptune or MLflow for experiment tracking?

## Polars and ML Tracking Integration

### Why Polars?

- **PySpark Compatibility**: Polars uses a similar lazy-execution model and API as PySpark, making future scaling easier
- **Performance**: Up to 10x faster than Pandas for many operations
- **Memory Efficiency**: Uses Arrow memory format for lower memory usage
- **Scalability**: Better suited for larger datasets
- **Modern API**: Functional API design with method chaining

### MLflow & Neptune Benefits

- **Experiment Tracking**: Track all model parameters, metrics, and artifacts
- **Model Registry**: Version and manage models centrally
- **Reproducibility**: Record all data transformations and training steps
- **Collaboration**: Share experiments and results among team members
- **Deployment**: Streamline model deployment to production
