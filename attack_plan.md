# Attack Plan for Tomorrow

## Morning Focus: Code Quality Fixes (2-3 hours)

### 1. Fix Syntax Error in tsmixer_model.py (30-45 min)

- Locate the file in the codebase
- Identify the syntax error (likely using linting tools)
- Fix the issue
- Add proper type annotations while editing
- Run tests to ensure functionality is preserved
- Commit the changes

### 2. Address Security Issue in main.py (30-45 min)

- Review the binding to 0.0.0.0
- Determine appropriate binding based on development context
- If localhost is sufficient for development, modify the code
- If binding to all interfaces is necessary, add comments explaining why and security implications
- Add configuration option to make it environment-dependent
- Test the changes locally
- Commit the changes

### 3. Review CI Pipeline for Integration (30-45 min)

- Examine ci_backend.yaml to understand current test and deploy processes
- Identify where new tests for data pipeline would fit
- Note any limitations or areas for improvement
- Ensure local environment matches CI environment

## Afternoon Focus: Data Pipeline Foundation (4-5 hours)

### 1. Design Core Data Pipeline Components (1 hour)

- Create interfaces/protocols.py for data pipeline abstractions:
  - DataReader (for various input sources)
  - DataValidator (for schema and content validation)
  - DataTransformer (for cleaning and feature engineering)
  - DataWriter (for saving processed data)
- Define clear interfaces with proper type annotations
- Document each interface with comprehensive docstrings

### 2. Implement Basic Data Reader (1-1.5 hours)

- Create data_reader.py with implementations for:
  - CSV reader
  - Excel reader
  - (Optional) JSON reader
- Add robust error handling
- Implement type validation for inputs
- Write unit tests for each reader implementation

### 3. Implement Data Validator (1-1.5 hours)

- Create data_validator.py with:
  - Schema validation using Pydantic models
  - Data type verification
  - Basic constraint checking (nulls, ranges, etc.)
- Implement configurable validation rules
- Add informative error messages for validation failures
- Write unit tests for validator

### 4. Begin Data Transformer (1 hour)

- Create data_transformer.py with initial functionality:
  - NaN handling (basic strategies)
  - Type conversion utilities
  - Simple statistical transformations
- Focus on clean interfaces first, basic implementations
- Add tests for transform functions

## End of Day: Documentation and Planning (30-45 min)

### 1. Document Progress

- Update README.md with new components and usage
- Add inline comments for complex logic
- Create examples of pipeline usage

### 2. Plan for Day 2

- Identify remaining data pipeline components to implement
- List any challenges encountered and possible solutions
- Set priorities for the next day's work

## Checklist of Deliverables

- [ ] Fixed syntax error in tsmixer_model.py
- [ ] Addressed security concerns in main.py
- [ ] Created interfaces/protocols.py with pipeline abstractions
- [ ] Implemented basic DataReader functionality with tests
- [ ] Implemented DataValidator with Pydantic integration
- [ ] Started DataTransformer implementation
- [ ] Updated documentation
- [ ] Created plan for day 2

## Notes on Implementation Approach

- Focus on proper type annotations throughout
- Follow SOLID principles for all new components
- Keep components loosely coupled for better testing
- Use dependency injection for flexibility
- Maintain compatibility with current Streamlit interface
- Prioritize clean interfaces over complex implementations initially
