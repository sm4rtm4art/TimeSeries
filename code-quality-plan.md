# Code Quality Improvement Plan

## Immediate Issues

1. **Fix Syntax Error in tsmixer_model.py**

   - Priority: High
   - Description: Bandit reports a syntax error preventing analysis
   - Action: Identify and fix the syntax problem

2. **Security Issue in main.py**
   - Priority: Medium
   - Description: Binding to all interfaces (0.0.0.0)
   - Action: Consider restricting to localhost for development or documenting the security implications

## Phased Implementation

### Phase 1: Critical Files

- Fix streamlit.py (docstrings, type annotations)
- Fix main.py (resolve security warning)
- Fix key utility files used by multiple components

### Phase 2: Core Business Logic

- Fix domain models
- Fix data processing components
- Add proper type annotations to core functions

### Phase 3: Full Compliance

- Address remaining linting issues
- Ensure comprehensive test coverage
- Document public APIs

## Pragmatic Approach

For immediate commits:

1. Fix the pyproject.toml configuration (completed)
2. Use `git commit --no-verify` for work-in-progress commits
3. Gradually introduce fixes in focused PRs
4. Consider temporarily disabling strict hooks during transition

## Recommended Next Steps

1. Fix the syntax error in tsmixer_model.py
2. Address streamlit.py issues as an example:
   - Add proper docstrings with periods
   - Add return type annotations (-> None)
3. Commit the configuration changes with --no-verify
4. Create a branch for ongoing code quality improvements
