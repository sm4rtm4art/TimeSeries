## Project Description

A comprehensive time series forecasting platform that enables management consultants to upload, clean, analyze, visualize, and forecast data with minimal technical knowledge. The platform follows clean code principles, SOLID design, and provides an intuitive interface with powerful backend capabilities.

## Key Features

1. **Data Upload & Validation**

   - Multi-format support (CSV, Excel, JSON)
   - Intelligent error detection and reporting
   - Schema inference with Pydantic validation

2. **Data Exploration & Cleaning**

   - Automated column type detection
   - Interactive data preview and profiling
   - Outlier detection and handling
   - NaN handling strategies

3. **Model Training & Selection**

   - Multiple time series models:
     - N-BEATS (Neural Basis Expansion Analysis for Interpretable Time Series Forecasting)
     - TIDE (Temporal Importance-Guided Denoising Encoder)
     - Prophet (Facebook's time series forecasting tool)
     - TimeMixer (A novel approach combining temporal convolutions and attention)
     - Chronos (A deep learning model for irregular time series)
     - TFT (Temporal Fusion Transformers)
     - ARIMA (Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average)
   - Automated model selection
   - Custom model configuration
   - Experiment tracking with MLflow/Neptune

4. **Forecasting & Analysis**

   - Interactive forecast visualization
   - Confidence intervals and uncertainty quantification
   - Feature importance analysis
   - What-if scenario testing

5. **Reporting & Export**
   - Customizable PDF reports
   - Excel/CSV exports with metadata
   - Interactive dashboard sharing
