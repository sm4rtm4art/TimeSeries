## Project Description

This project explores various approaches to time series analysis and forecasting, ranging from classical methods to cutting-edge techniques. Our goal is to implement, compare, and analyze different time series models, providing a comprehensive toolkit for researchers and practitioners in the field.

Key features of this project include:

1. Implementation of multiple time series models, including:

   - N-BEATS (Neural Basis Expansion Analysis for Interpretable Time Series Forecasting)
   - TIDE (Temporal Importance-Guided Denoising Encoder)
   - Prophet (Facebook's time series forecasting tool)
   - TimeMixer (A novel approach combining temporal convolutions and attention mechanisms)
   - Chronos (A deep learning model for irregular time series)
   - TFT (Temporal Fusion Transformers for interpretable multi-horizon forecasting)
   - ARIMA (Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average) - planned
   - LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) neural networks - planned

2. Utilities for data preprocessing, including scaling and tensor manipulation
3. Model training, prediction, and evaluation functionalities
4. Support for both single-step and multi-step forecasting
5. Integration with PyTorch Lightning for accelerated training of neural network-based models
6. Streamlit-based progress visualization during model training
7. Comparative analysis tools to evaluate model performance across different techniques

Future enhancements:

- Implementation of multivariate time series analysis capabilities
- Integration of explainable AI tools for better model interpretability

This project aims to provide a versatile platform for time series analysis, enabling users to experiment with various forecasting techniques, from traditional statistical methods to state-of-the-art machine learning approaches. By implementing multiple models, we facilitate easy comparison and selection of the most suitable method for specific time series problems, while also planning to expand into multivariate analysis and explainable AI methodologies.
