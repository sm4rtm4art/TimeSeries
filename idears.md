# Future implementation ideas

## Multiple time series analysis

Implementing multiple time series analysises to get information about the relationships between the time series. And forcast the development of the time series.
Adding shape values (explainable AI) To the values to get the feature importance and reduce the dimensionality of the data, to improve the fitting.

## Automatic preprocessing of the data

implementatiomn of an anomaly detection system to the data. Detecting the outliers and missing values. And then imputing the missing values and removing the outliers.

or focussing on the outlyier, give the person the oppertunity to remove the outliers or the missing values or how to impute them.

## Trying out LLM's
